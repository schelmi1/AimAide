# AimAide for CSGO ~~and soon CS2~~

*UPDATE!
<br>as long as raw input can not be disabled in CS2 the mouse mover does not work.<br>
models seem to work tho

External realtime object detection-based aim aiding powered by <b>YOLOv8</b>, <b>CUDA</b> and <b>TensorRT</b><br>

<br>
<b>13/09/23</b><br>
fixed initial TensorRT engine building when starting for the first time from webui launcher<br>

<br>
<br>
25/07/23<br>
-added a webui launcher for comfortably changing settings<br>
just run launcher.py from your command line

-new model which is optimized on heads on mirage (high headshot rate, --minconf 0.6 recommended)<br>
models/yolov8s_csgo_mirage-320-v62-pal-gen-bg-head.pt<br>
-added flickieness argument to control how fast the mouse mover should flick to target
<br><br>
09/05/23 - bug in d3d_np grabber fixed (mixed up color channels), code improvements, removed engines from repo (engines will built locally),<br> d3d_gpu is disabled and needs to be rewritten<br>
16/04/23 - engine builder added to circumvent TensorRT incompatibilities <br>(by https://github.com/triple-Mu/YOLOv8-TensorRT)<br>
15/04/23 - introduced 320x320 input models which drastically increase fps with YOLO and TensorRT<br>


<h3>Supported Maps</h3>
* Mirage

<h3>Road Map</h3>
Models for CS2 and support for additional maps<br>
Human-like aim methods (like windmouse or ai-based)

<h3>Features</h3>
YOLOv8 Models trained on mirage with various CT and T agents (body and head).<br>
Simple smooth linear mouse mover locking onto target closest to crosshair.<br>

<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
To get this to work the detector has to run at 30fps at least.<br>
NVIDIA GTX1070 runs at 30fps on a 640x640 model or 60fps on a 320x320 model with TensorRT.<br>
NVIDIA RTX4090 should max out at ~120fps on a 640x640 model. (also TensorRT)<br>

<h3>Installation</h3>
1) NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit >= 11.7<br>
2) Python 3.10.6 environment<br>
3) Corresponding PyTorch CUDA Package -> https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/<br>
4) pip install -r requirements.txt<br><br>
<b>Optional but recommended:</b><br>
5) NVIDIA TensorRT >= 8.4 -> https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt -> https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/install-guide/index.html<br> 
<br>
Speedup for bigger models with TensorRT is significant.<br>
<s>Thats why all models bigger than medium will only be released as TensorRT engines</s>.<br>
Models will be released as YOLO weights and locally built as TensorRT engines on first start up.<br>
This is due to TensorRT version incompatibilities.<br>

<h3>Usage</h3>
I) Disable windows mouse acceleration<br>
II) Disable raw input in CSGO<br>
III) Cap max_fps in CSGO at your native display refresh rate<br>
<br>
1) Run either run_tensorrt.py or run_yolo.py<br>
2) Selective detection can be activated by running with argument <b>-side 'your side'</b> (t, ct or dm for detecting all)<br>
If you want to change the detection mode while the script is running, simply write 't', 'ct' or 'dm' into the console and hit enter<br><br>
<img src="/docs/side_switch.png"><br>
3) Depending on your hardware choose from 3 different models (nano, small, medium)<br>
nano (highest framerate, lowest detection performance),<br>
medium (lowest framerate, best decetion performance)<br>
4) Run in benchmark mode first to see what framerate you get (over 60fps increase sensitivity mode)<br>
5) Adjust mouse sensitivity in CS and/or sensitivity mode of AimAide

<h3>Benchmark mode</h3>
Run run_tensorrt.py or run_yolo.py with argument <b>--benchmark</b> to start in benchmark mode.<br>
This is going to run the detector in view-only- and detect-all mode for 300 iterations.<br>
Switch to CSGO and run/look around. At the end the average fps of the detector during that time will be displayed.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
Q: Why does AimAide seem to be stuck on launch?<br>
A: This is a known issue with the YOLO class, run your command line as administrator.<br>
<br>
Q: Why is the aiming is so chaotic and unnatural?<br>
A: Probably due to high detector framerate. Increase the sensitivity mode by running with arg -sensitivity (default is 1)<br>
<br>
Q: Why is the aiming is so slow and laggy?<br>
A: Probably due to low detector framerate. Run benchmark mode and check if you get an average fps of at least 30 while being ingame.<br>

Feel free to fork this repo and/or use the models for your own projects. :)
